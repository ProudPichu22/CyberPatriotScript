## This is a checklist for CyberPatriots based on actual practice images:

---- System Configuration ----
Windows Updates
Update Programs
Remove unauthorized users
Change user privileges
Change insecure passwords
Secure maximum password age
Secure minimum password age
Secure lockout threshold
Limit local use of blank passwords to console only [Enabled]
Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts [Enabled]
Add/Remove users to group
Add/Remove group (If needed)
Ensure unused or default accounts are disabled or removed.
Disable guest accounts.
Check for and remove default shared folders (e.g., ADMIN$, C$, IPC$).
Restrict access to the Control Panel or Settings.
Configure account lockout duration and reset settings.
Enforce multi-factor authentication (if applicable).
Disable Legacy Features (e.g., LM Hash, NTLMv1 authentication).
Enable Secure Boot in BIOS/UEFI.
Configure timeouts: Set screen saver timeout and require password on resumption.
Patch Firmware: Update BIOS/UEFI and network device firmware.

---- Network Configuration ----
Secure DNS Settings: Use secure DNS resolvers like DNS over HTTPS (DoH).
Restrict Remote Access: Limit RDP and other remote access to trusted IPs or VPN.
Disable Unnecessary Network Shares: Remove or secure public network shares.
Configure VLANs: Segment networks for better isolation (e.g., user, server, IoT).


---- Security Settings ---- 
Behavior of the elevation prompt for administrators in Admin Approval Mode configured to prompt
RDP network level authentication enabled
RDP Security Layer set to SSL
Windows SmartScreen configured to warn or block
Enable firewall
Passwords meet complexity requirements
Disable unnecessary ports and protocols (e.g., SMBv1, Telnet).
Ensure the latest security baselines are applied.
Enable logging and configure log retention policies.
Set antivirus to scan regularly and ensure it is updated.
Disable USB drives if not necessary (via Group Policy)
Configure UAC to Always Notify


---- Service Management ---- 
FTP service [Stop & Disable]
World Wide Web Publishing Service [Stop & Disable]
Verify unnecessary services are stopped and disabled (e.g., Telnet, Remote Registry, SNMP).
Disable or remove services related to legacy systems or apps no longer in use.

---- Access & Object Control ---- 
Configure global object access
AutoPlay has been disabled [All Users]
Unauthorized Items
Remove prohibited files
Remove unwanted programs
Stop any unauthorized processes
Implement least privilege principles for all user and admin accounts.
Set permissions for system files and directories appropriately.
Disable Allow log on locally for sensitive accounts (e.g., admin, service accounts).
Audit and secure access to critical registry keys.

---- Audit and Forensics ---- 
Audit Credential Validation [Success]
Complete Forensic Questions
Ensure logs are being collected and centralized (if using a SIEM tool).
Review logs for signs of suspicious activity.
Confirm proper time synchronization (NTP configuration).

---- User Account Security ---- 
Review Group Memberships: Ensure only authorized users are in privileged groups.
Monitor Last Login Times: Identify and address stale or unused accounts.
Use Account Naming Conventions: Standardize naming (e.g., svc_[purpose] for service accounts).

---- Data Protection ---- 
Encrypt Data: Use encryption for sensitive files and drives (e.g., BitLocker).
Configure Backup Policies: Schedule automated backups with secure storage.
Secure Temporary Files: Regularly clear temporary files and cache.

---- Advanced Security Practices ---- 
Enable AppLocker or Software Restriction Policies: Whitelist approved applications.
Configure Event Subscriptions: Forward critical events to a central logging server.
Perform Penetration Testing: Simulate attacks to identify vulnerabilities.
Monitor Active Directory: Detect anomalies (e.g., Kerberoasting, golden tickets).

---- Documentation and Communication ---- 
Create Incident Response Plans: Develop procedures for addressing security breaches.
Document All Changes: Log changes made during sessions for auditing purposes.
Conduct Training: Regularly train team members on cybersecurity threats and best practices.
